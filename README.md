      AirBnB Clone - The Console
Project Description
Welcome to the AirBnB Clone project! This project aims to build a command-line interface (CLI) to manage AirBnB objects. It serves as the initial step towards constructing a full web application, covering essential concepts such as Python packages, object-oriented programming (OOP), serialization, and more. Through this project, we aim to create a robust and efficient system for managing AirBnB properties.

Command Interpreter
The command interpreter allows users to perform various operations on AirBnB objects, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting objects. It provides a simple yet powerful interface to interact with the underlying data model. To start the command interpreter, execute the console.py script. Once launched, you can input commands and arguments to perform desired operations.

How to Start:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/AirBnB_clone.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd AirBnB_clone
Launch the command interpreter: ./console.py
How to Use:
Once the command interpreter is running, you can input commands following the specified format. Use the help command to display available commands and their usage. Refer to the project documentation and examples for detailed instructions on using specific commands.

Examples:
Creating a new User object: create User
Retrieving objects from storage: show User
Updating attributes of an object: update User 1234 name "John Doe"
Deleting an object: destroy User 1234
